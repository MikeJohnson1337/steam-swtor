1. Build Program.cs one of two ways:
  A. Average Joe:
    1. Copy the contents of [Program.cs]
       (https://raw.github.com/calebthompson/steam-swtor/master/Program.cs)
       into a text file called `Star Wars - The Old Republic.txt` on your
       desktop.
    2. Open a command prompt
         `Start Menu -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt`
    3. Copy/Paste the following command into the Command Prompt and hit enter.
       The code will take the contents of the text file you pasted and pass
       them into the C# (C Sharp) compiler on your system.  It will create an
       exe file, `Star Wars - The Old Republic.exe` for you.
    4. Copy `Star Wars - The Old Republic.exe` from your desktop into SWToR's
       install folder.  It is likely located at
       `C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\BioWare\Star Wars - The Old Republic\`
    5. Go into Steam and add the executable you just made to your Steam Library.
  B. Programmer
    1. There's a whole Visual Studio 2010 solution here.
    2. You are a programmer.  Figure it out.

  If things still don't work, please open an issue.
